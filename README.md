Our plan is to make a website that contains all the legends from League of Legends
The main page will have all of the legends on it. As a user clicks on the legend it'll go to a dedicated webpage for that legend.
This webpage displays all the information of that Legend also providing pictures of the legend and their skills.

Our steps to completion:
Step 1: Make the Champion Template
Step 2: Split 7 Champions to three people and 6 Champions and Main Page to one person
Step 3: Profit (Copy Paste info)


we'll do the Marksman which contains 27 Champions:

Aphelios | Ashe | Azir | Caitlyn | Corki | Draven | Ezreal | Graves | Jayce

Jhin | Jinx | Kai'sa | Kalista | Kennen | Kindred | Kog'maw | Lucian | Miss Fortune

Quinn | Senna | Sivir | Teemo | Tristana | Twitch | Varus | Vayne | Xayah
